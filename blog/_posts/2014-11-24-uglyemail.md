description: "Gmail Extension To Check If Email Is Being Tracked."
---

Did you know that you know that the emails you receive most likely are being tracked? The sender can see if you opened the email, and where and what device you used it to view the email.

That might sound like something out of the movies or something you hear on the news about NSA. However, emails can be easily tracked using third party Gmail extensions like Streak, BananaTag and Yesware.
To avoid being tracked, I recently decided to develop a Gmail Extension called Ugly Email. This tiny extension checks if the emails in my inbox contains a tracking pixel and adds an indicator.

Ugly Email is available via Google Chrome Store and [uglyemail.com](http://uglyemail.com) for free.
