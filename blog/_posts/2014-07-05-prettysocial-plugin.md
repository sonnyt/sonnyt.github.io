If you're like me and dislike default social share buttons I wrote a little jQuery plugin that allows you to define your own custom buttons. Check it out on [github](https://github.com/sonnyt/prettySocial), documentation is there. I use this plugin on all my themeforest themes, you also check out the [demo page](http://sonnyt.com/prettySocial/) to see it in use.
