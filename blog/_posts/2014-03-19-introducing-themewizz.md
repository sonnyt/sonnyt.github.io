I am proud to announce that starting today, all my themes will be moved over to their own property. Recently I've decided to rebrand all my Envato products and give them their own home. After few frustrating weeks of figuring out a name, I concluded on ThemeWizz.
<!--break-->
I will continue actively supporting and further develop all of my themes, just under a new name; ThemeWizz. I believe this decision will give me the freedom to collaborate with other designers as well as an opportunity to shamelessly market all my products without polluting my own name.

Another great benefit of rebranding is the ability to contract/hire people to produce beautiful themes and plugins. Which will give me more time to focus on creating more open source projects like, [downCount.js](http://sonnyt.com/downcount-plugin/ "downCount.js") and [Tweetie.js](http://sonnyt.com/tweetie-plugin/ "Tweetie").

So please [follow ThemeWizz on twitter](http://twtitter.com/themewizz "ThemeWizz Twitter") and let me know what you think of the site design, [themewizz.com](http://themewizz.com/ "ThemeWizz").
